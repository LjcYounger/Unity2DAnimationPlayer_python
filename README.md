# Unity Animation Player for Python

These scripts enable you to play smooth 2D/3D(maybe) Unity animations in Python.
In fact, it automatically interpolates all directions; I'm just sampling a subset in the AnimationPlayer.


## Usage

- Use `"python example.py"` to test the example
- Use `"python visualization.py"` to visualize T.anim (contains almost all Unity interpolation methods)

## Disadvantages

- Does not support weightMode, even when attempting to calculate it in the code
