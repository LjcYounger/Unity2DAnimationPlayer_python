# Unity 2D Animation Player for Python

These scripts allow you to play smooth 2D Unity animations in Python.

## Usage

- Use `"python example.py"` to test the example
- Use `"python visualization.py"` to visualize T.anim (contains almost all Unity interpolation methods)

## Hint

- In fact, it automatically interpolates all directions; I'm just sampling a subset in the AnimationPlayer.

## Disadvantages

- Does not support weightMode, even when attempting to calculate it in the code
